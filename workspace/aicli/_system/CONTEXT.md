- **db_tables_unified**: mem_ai_events, mem_ai_tags_relations, mem_ai_project_facts, mem_ai_work_items, mem_ai_features

## In Progress

- Tag column schema correction: fixed mem_ai_tags_relations table reference (was mng_ai_tags_relations) in DDL and verified database migrations applied
- Memory file generation automation: CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, context.md, rules.md, copilot.md auto-regenerated from mem_ai_project_facts, mem_ai_work_items, sessions
- Tag storage architecture clarification: tags belong in mem_ai_tags_relations (linked via row id), not summary_tags array; tags sourced from MRR when applicable
- Schema column cleanup: validating relevance of language and file_path columns in mem_ai_events; removing unnecessary metadata fields
- Data persistence validation: tags disappearing on session switch root cause investigation (DDL now updated, testing persistence)
- Backend startup race condition: AiCli appearing in Recent projects but remaining unselectable due to dev environment initialization delay

## Key Decisions

- Engine/workspace separation: aicli/ backend logic; workspace/ per-project content; _system/ project state
- Dual storage model: PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector (1536-dim, text-embedding-3-small) for semantic search; per-project schemas
- Electron UI with xterm.js + Monaco editor + Cytoscape.js; Vanilla JS frontend (no framework/bundler); Vite dev server
- JWT authentication (python-jose + bcrypt) with DEV_MODE toggle; 3-tier roles (admin/paid/free); per-user encrypted API keys
- All LLM providers as independent adapters (Claude Haiku for synthesis); server holds API keys; client sends none
- Async DAG workflow executor via asyncio.gather with loop-back and max_iterations cap; Cytoscape.js visualization with approval
- Memory synthesis: Claude Haiku dual-layer (raw JSONL → interaction_tags → 5 output files); reduces token overhead
- Unified event table mem_ai_events (id, project_id, session_id, session_desc, event_summary) consolidates pr_embeddings/pr_memory_events with event_type column
- Table naming convention: mem_ai_* prefix; mem_ai_tags_relations, mem_ai_project_facts, mem_ai_work_items, mem_ai_features
- Hierarchical data model: Clients contain multiple Users; authentication pattern: login_as_first_level_hierarchy
- _ensure_shared_schema pattern replaces ensure_project_schema; retry logic handles empty project list on first load
- Tags load once on project access into memory; cache invalidation on session/project switch forces re-load from DB
- Manual relations managed via CLI/admin UI; types: depends_on, relates_to, blocks, implements
- MCP server (stdio) with 12+ tools; configured via env vars (BACKEND_URL, ACTIVE_PROJECT); embedding and data retrieval
- Memory management pattern: load_once_on_access, update_on_save; triggered by memory endpoint and synthesis layer

# aicli — Shared AI Memory Platform

_Last updated: 2026-03-14 | Version 2.2.0_

---

## Vision

**aicli gives every LLM the same project memory.**

When you switch between Claude CLI, the aicli terminal, Cursor, or the web UI, the AI picks up
exactly where you left off — same codebase context, same decisions, same feature history.
No more copy-pasting context. No more re-explaining your architecture.

---

## Core Goals

| # | Goal | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | **Shared LLM memory** — Claude CLI, aicli CLI, Cursor, UI all read the same knowledge base | ✓ Implemented |
| 2 | **Prompt management** — Role-based agents (architect, developer, reviewer, QA, security, devops) | ✓ Implemented |
| 3 | **5-layer memory** — Immediate → Working → Project → Historical → Global | ✓ Implemented |
| 4 | **Auto-deploy** — pull → commit → push after every AI session | ✓ Hooks + git.py |
| 5 | **Billing & usage** — Multi-user, server keys, balance, markup, coupons | ✓ Implemented |
| 6 | **Multi-LLM workflows** — Graph DAG: design → review → develop → test | ✓ Implemented |
| 7 | **Entity/knowledge graph** — Tag every event (prompt/commit) to features, bugs, tasks | ✓ Implemented |
| 8 | **Semantic search** — pgvector cosine similarity over chunked history + code | ✓ Implemented |
| 9 | **Project management UI** — Unified Planner: 2-pane tag manager, per-entry tagging, commit linking | ✓ Implemented |

---

## 5-Layer Memory Architecture

```
Layer 1 — Immediate Context
  └── providers/{claude,openai,...}.messages  (in-memory, not persisted)
      Live conversation: current prompt chain within the session

Layer 2 — Working Memory
  └── {cli_data_dir}/sessions/{provider}_messages.json
  └── {cli_data_dir}/session_state.json
      Short-term task state: active feature, tag, last commit, cross-provider handoff

Layer 3 — Project Knowledge
  └── workspace/{project}/PROJECT.md          — living project doc (this file)
  └── workspace/{project}/_system/project_state.json  — structured metadata + next_phase_plan
  └── workspace/{project}/_system/CLAUDE.md   — synced to code_dir/CLAUDE.md for Claude Code

Layer 4 — Historical Knowledge
  └── workspace/{project}/_system/history.jsonl    — all interactions (UI + CLI + workflow + Cursor)
  └── workspace/{project}/_system/events_{p}       — PostgreSQL event log, tagged to features/bugs
      Past decisions, design discussions, feature history, bug postmortems, refactor notes

Layer 5 — Global Knowledge
  └── workspace/_templates/hooks/                  — canonical hook scripts for all projects
  └── workspace/_templates/{blank,python_api,...}  — project starter templates
  └── workspace/_templates/workflows/              — shared workflow YAML library (planned)
  └── workspace/_templates/roles/                  — shared AI role prompts (planned)
```

### How `/memory` syncs layers 3–5 to every LLM tool

```
_system/claude/CLAUDE.md   →  {code_dir}/CLAUDE.md                    ← Claude Code reads at start
_system/claude/MEMORY.md   →  {code_dir}/MEMORY.md                    ← referenced in CLAUDE.md
_system/cursor/rules.md    →  {code_dir}/.cursor/rules/aicli.mdrules  ← Cursor reads on open
_system/aicli/context.md   →  prepended to every aicli CLI prompt      ← all providers
_system/aicli/copilot.md   →  {code_dir}/.github/copilot-instructions.md
```
