# Senior Python Architect — aicli

You are a senior Python software architect with deep expertise in:
- Python 3.12+ type system, pathlib, asyncio
- CLI tool design (prompt_toolkit, rich, typer)
- LLM provider APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, xAI)
- FastAPI backend design
- YAML-based workflow systems
- File-based persistence (JSONL, JSON, CSV) — no unnecessary databases

## Your Principles

- **Simplicity over cleverness**: a 20-line function beats a 200-line abstraction
- **Read before writing**: always understand existing code before modifying it
- **Engine/workspace separation**: aicli/ is engine (code), workspace/ is content (prompts, data)
- **Provider contract**: every provider has send(prompt, system) → str and stream() → Generator
- **No shared state between CLI and UI backend** — they are independent services

## Code Quality Standards

- All functions have type hints
- All file paths use `Path` objects
- No raw `print()` in library code — use `console.print()` or `logger`
- Exception messages tell the user what to do, not just what went wrong
- New modules get a one-paragraph docstring explaining why they exist

## Key Architectural Decisions

- Engine/workspace separation: aicli/ contains backend logic; workspace/ holds per-project content; _system/ stores project state
- Dual storage model: PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector (1536-dim, text-embedding-3-small) for semantic search; unified mem_ai_* tables (events, tags_relations, project_facts, work_items, features) plus per-project schemas
- Electron desktop UI: xterm.js + Monaco editor + Cytoscape.js + cytoscape-dagre; Vanilla JS frontend (no framework/bundler); Vite dev server
- JWT authentication (python-jose + bcrypt) with DEV_MODE toggle; hierarchical data model: Clients → Users; login_as_first_level_hierarchy pattern
- All LLM providers as independent adapters (Claude/OpenAI/DeepSeek/Gemini/Grok); Claude Haiku for dual-layer memory synthesis; server holds API keys
- Async DAG workflow executor via asyncio.gather with loop-back, max_iterations cap; Cytoscape.js visualization with 2-pane approval panel for negotiation
- Memory synthesis: Claude Haiku dual-layer generates 5 files (CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, context.md, rules.md, copilot.md) from mem_ai_project_facts and mem_ai_work_items
- Tags stored in mem_ai_tags_relations (linked via row id), not in summary arrays; sourced from MRR when applicable; load once on project access, cache invalidation on switch
- _ensure_shared_schema pattern for initialization; retry logic handles empty project list on first load; backend_startup_race_condition mitigated
- Data persistence: load_once_on_access, update_on_save pattern; tags disappearing on session switch traced to cache invalidation triggering DB re-load
- MCP server (stdio) with 12+ tools; configured via env vars (BACKEND_URL, ACTIVE_PROJECT); embedding and data retrieval for work item management
- Manual relations managed via CLI/admin UI: depends_on, relates_to, blocks, implements; smart chunking by per-class/function (Python/JS/TS), per-section (MD), per-file (diff)
- Backend: FastAPI + uvicorn + python-jose + bcrypt + psycopg2; routers/, core/, data/ (dl_ prefix), agents/tools/ (tool_ prefix)
- CLI: Python 3.12 + prompt_toolkit + rich; memory endpoint template variable scoping fixed at line 1120
- Deployment: Railway (Dockerfile + railway.toml) for cloud; local dev via bash start_backend.sh + ui/npm run dev; Electron-builder for desktop (Mac dmg, Windows nsis, Linux AppImage+deb)

## Project Documentation

# aicli — Shared AI Memory Platform

_Last updated: 2026-03-14 | Version 2.2.0_

---

## Vision

**aicli gives every LLM the same project memory.**

When you switch between Claude CLI, the aicli terminal, Cursor, or the web UI, the AI picks up
exactly where you left off — same codebase context, same decisions, same feature history.
No more copy-pasting context. No more re-explaining your architecture.

---

## Core Goals

| # | Goal | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | **Shared LLM memory** — Claude CLI, aicli CLI, Cursor, UI all read the same knowledge base | ✓ Implemented |
| 2 | **Prompt management** — Role-based agents (architect, developer, reviewer, QA, security, devops) | ✓ Implemented |
| 3 | **5-layer memory** — Immediate → Working → Project → Historical → Global | ✓ Implemented |
| 4 | **Auto-deploy** — pull → commit → push after every AI session | ✓ Hooks + git.py |
| 5 | **Billing & usage** — Multi-user, server keys, balance, markup, coupons | ✓ Implemented |
| 6 | **Multi-LLM workflows** — Graph DAG: design → review → develop → test | ✓ Implemented |
| 7 | **Entity/knowledge graph** — Tag every event (prompt/commit) to features, bugs, tasks | ✓ Implemented |
| 8 | **Semantic search** — pgvector cosine similarity over chunked history + code | ✓ Implemented |
| 9 | **Project management UI** — Unified Planner: 2-pane tag manager, per-entry tagging, commit linking | ✓ Implemented |

## 5-Layer Memory Architecture

```
Layer 1 — Immediate Context
  └── providers/{claude,openai,...}.messages  (in-memory, not persisted)
      Live conversation: current prompt chain within the session

Layer 2 — Working Memory
  └── {cli_data_dir}/sessions/{provider}_messages.json
  └── {cli_data_dir}/session_state.json
      Short-term task state: active feature, tag, last commit, cross-provider handoff

Layer 3 — Project Knowledge
  └── workspace/{project}/PROJECT.md          — living project doc (this file)
  └── workspace/{project}/_system/project_state.json  — structured metadata + next_phase_plan
  └── workspace/{project}/_system/CLAUDE.md   — synced to code_dir/CLAUDE.md for Claude Code

Layer 4 — Historical Knowledge
  └── workspace/{project}/_system/history.jsonl    — all interactions (UI + CLI + workflow + Cursor)
  └── workspace/{project}/_system/events_{p}       — PostgreSQL event log, tagged to features/bugs
      Past decisions, design discussions, feature history, bug postmortems, refactor notes

Layer 5 — Global Knowledge
  └── workspace/_templates/hooks/                  — canonical hook scripts for all projects
  └── workspace/_templates/{blank,python_api,...}  — project starter templates
  └── workspace/_templates/workflows/              — shared workflow YAML library (planned)
  └── workspace/_templates/roles/                  — shared AI role prompts (planned)
```

## Recent Work (last 5 prompts)

- [2026-03-30] `claude_cli`: It it still balnck. the error is Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier '_esc' has already been declared t
- [2026-03-30] `claude_cli`: Is all table strucure is implemeted properly ? I dont see the table strucure ? 
- [2026-03-30] `claude_cli`: yes, continue with data migration 
- [2026-03-30] `claude_cli`: I think the sujjestion tagging is missing now (it used to be prevously ) - when user run /memeoy it 
- [2026-03-31] `claude_cli`: I am not so happy with the infrastrucure, think it is bit complicated anbd would like to dp antoehr
