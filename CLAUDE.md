## Vision
**aicli gives every LLM the same project memory.**
When you switch between Claude Code, the aicli CLI, Cursor, or the web UI, the AI picks up
exactly where you left off — same codebase context, same decisions, same feature history.
No more copy-pasting context. No more re-explaining your architecture.

## Core Goals
| # | Goal | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | **Shared LLM memory** — Claude Code, aicli CLI, Cursor all read the same knowledge base | ✓ Implemented |
| 2 | **Backlog pipeline** — Mirror → Backlog digest → User review → Use case files | ✓ Implemented |
| 3 | **Work Items** — AI-classified backlog items (open → active → done) backed by `mem_work_items` | ✓ Implemented |
| 4 | **Auto-deploy** — Stop hook → auto_commit_push.sh after every Claude Code session | ✓ Hooks |
| 5 | **Billing & usage** — Multi-user, server keys, balance, markup, coupons | ✓ Implemented |
| 6 | **Multi-LLM workflows** — Graph DAG: design → review → develop → test | ✓ Implemented |
| 7 | **Semantic search** — pgvector cosine similarity over events | ✓ Implemented |
| 8 | **Role YAML** — All agent roles + pipelines defined in `workspace/_templates/` (no inline Python) | ✓ Refactor

## Stack & Architecture

- **cli**: Python 3.12 + prompt_toolkit + rich
- **backend**: FastAPI + uvicorn + python-jose + bcrypt + psycopg2
- **frontend**: Vanilla JS + Electron + Vite
- **ui_components**: xterm.js + Monaco editor + Cytoscape.js
- **storage**: PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector (1536-dim, text-embedding-3-small)
- **authentication**: JWT (python-jose + bcrypt) + DEV_MODE
- **llm_providers**: Claude (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus) + OpenAI (GPT-4/mini) + DeepSeek + Gemini + Grok
- **workflow_engine**: Async DAG executor (asyncio.gather) + YAML config + per-node retry + 4-agent pipeline (PM→Architect→Developer→Reviewer)
- **memory_synthesis**: Claude Haiku (project_state.json) + 5 output files with pgvector embeddings for approved work items only
- **chunking**: Smart: per-class/function (Python/JS/TS) + per-section (Markdown) + per-file (diffs)
- **mcp**: Stdio MCP server with 14 tools (search_memory, get_project_state, tags, backlog, create_entity, list_work_items, etc.)
- **deployment_backend**: Railway (Dockerfile + railway.toml)
- **deployment_desktop**: Electron-builder (Mac dmg, Windows nsis, Linux AppImage+deb)
- **database_migrations**: PostgreSQL with m001-m080 framework (m080 adds 4-agent pipeline columns)
- **code_parser**: tree-sitter (Python/JavaScript/TypeScript) for per-symbol diffs and hotspot detection

## Key Architectural Decisions

- Memory architecture: 3 layers — raw captures (mem_mrr_*), structured artifacts (mem_ai_project_facts), and work items (mem_work_items) with pgvector embeddings for approved items only (1536-dim, text-embedding-3-small).
- Work items: unified hierarchy with wi_parent_id linking features/bugs/tasks to use_case parents; approved items (wi_id: UC/FE/BU/TA) embed and trigger 4-agent pipeline; unapproved drafts (AI prefix) never embed.
- File generation: /memory POST endpoint is the ONLY writer to project_state.json via get_project_context() + Haiku synthesis; this single JSON drives all 5 output files (CLAUDE.md, CODE.md, PROJECT.md, cursor/rules, api/).
- File management: backend/memory/memory.yaml is canonical single-source mapping for output files; templates/ holds seed files; memory.yaml is internal engine only, not copied to projects.
- Code.md structure: public symbols (classes/methods/functions) with file coupling/hotspot tables; generated from mem_mrr_commits_code per commit and refreshed post-memory via unified get_project_context() path.
- Prompts: all backend LLM prompts in YAML under backend/memory/prompts/ named by trigger (command_memory.yaml, event_commit.yaml, command_work_items.yaml, mem_project_state.yaml, mem_session_tags.yaml, misc.yaml); loaded via prompt_loader utility.
- LLM provider adapters: Claude/OpenAI/DeepSeek/Gemini/Grok as independent modules in agents/providers/ with send(prompt, system) → str contract.
- Embeddings: ONLY approved work items embed; code.md, project_state.json, project facts, and prompts are NOT embedded; /search/semantic searches work_items only.
- Work item re-embedding: triggered only on name/summary/description edits for approved items via automatic flag in update(); unapproved drafts never re-embed.
- Commit-sourced work items: regex 'fixes BU0012'/'closes FE0001' in commit message auto-sets score_status=5 and score_importance=5; user must approve to update user_status to 'done'.
- MCP tools: 14 tools rewired to REST endpoints (search_memory, get_project_state, tags, backlog, create_entity→POST /wi/, list_work_items, run_work_item_pipeline, update_work_item, approve_work_items, get_file_history, etc.).
- Database queries: recursive CTEs bounded (depth < 20); batch queries replace N+1 patterns; hotspot checks use single WHERE name = ANY(%s); token counting: len(text) // 4.
- Code organization: memory_work_items.py split into _wi_helpers.py, _wi_classify.py, _wi_markdown.py with shared imports; all modules < 1500 lines.
- JWT auth: hierarchical Clients→Users→Projects; DEV_MODE toggle for passwordless local development.
- Memory file convergence: unified get_project_context() path confirmed for /memory POST and commit/work-item triggers; all 5 output files regenerated from single DB source.

## In Progress

- `TA4001` Audit and clean planner_tags table schema

## Coding Conventions

- **Python style**: Python 3.12+; type hints on all new functions; no `from X import *`
- **Imports**: stdlib → third-party → local; each group alphabetically sorted
- **Async**: use `async`/`await` throughout FastAPI routes; no blocking calls in async context
- **DB access**: always use `db.conn()` context manager (psycopg2 pool); parameterized queries only
- **Error handling**: log with `log.warning()` for expected errors, `log.exception()` for unexpected; return 422/404 from routes, never 500 for known cases
- **Naming**: `snake_case` for Python; `camelCase` for JS; `UPPER_SNAKE` for module-level constants
- **LLM prompts**: all prompts in `backend/prompts/*.yaml`; load via `prompt_loader.prompts.content(key)`; never inline strings
- **Work items**: `user_status` is TEXT (`open|pending|
