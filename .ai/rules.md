## Tech Stack

- **cli**: Python 3.12 + prompt_toolkit + rich
- **backend**: FastAPI + uvicorn + python-jose + bcrypt + psycopg2
- **frontend**: Vanilla JS (no framework, no bundler) + Electron shell + Vite dev server
- **ui_components**: xterm.js (embedded terminal) + Monaco editor + Cytoscape.js (graph flows) + cytoscape-dagre
- **storage_primary**: JSONL (history.jsonl with rotation to history_YYMMDDHHSS.jsonl, commit_log.jsonl), JSON, CSV
- **storage_semantic**: PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector (1536-dim, text-embedding-3-small)
- **db_schema**: Per-project: commits_{p}, events_{p}, embeddings_{p}, event_tags_{p}, event_links_{p}, memory_items_{p}, project_facts_{p}, pr_graph_runs; shared: users, usage_logs, transactions, session_tags, entity_categories, entity_values, agent_roles, system_roles
- **authentication**: JWT (python-jose) + bcrypt + DEV_MODE toggle; 3 roles: admin/paid/free
- **llm_providers**: Claude (Haiku for synthesis), OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok
- **workflow_engine**: Async DAG executor (asyncio.gather for parallel nodes) + YAML config; per-node retry/continue logic
- **workflow_ui**: Cytoscape.js + cytoscape-dagre for graph visualization; 2-pane approval panel for chat negotiation
- **memory_synthesis**: Claude Haiku for dual-layer (raw JSONL → interaction_tags → 5 output files)
- **chunking**: Smart chunking: summary + per-class/function (Python/JS/TS) + per-section (MD) + per-file (diff)
- **mcp**: Stdio MCP server with 12+ tools; configured via env vars (BACKEND_URL, ACTIVE_PROJECT)
- **deployment**: Railway (Dockerfile + railway.toml); local: bash ui/start.sh; desktop: Electron-builder
- **database_schema**: Per-project: commits_{p}, events_{p}, embeddings_{p}, event_tags_{p}, event_links_{p}, memory_items_{p}, project_facts_{p}, pr_graph_runs; shared: users, usage_logs, transactions, session_tags, entity_categories, entity_values, agent_roles, system_roles
- **config_management**: config.py with externalized backend_url, haiku_model, db_pool_max, MCP settings, agent role providers; YAML config for pipeline definitions
- **db_tables**: Per-project: commits_{p}, events_{p}, embeddings_{p}, event_tags_{p}, event_links_{p}, memory_items_{p}, project_facts_{p}, pr_graph_runs; shared: users, usage_logs, transactions, session_tags, entity_categories, entity_values, agent_roles, system_roles
- **llm_provider_adapters**: agents/providers/ with pr_ prefix for pricing and provider implementations
- **pipeline_engine**: Async DAG executor (asyncio.gather for parallel nodes) + YAML config; per-node retry/continue logic; centralized under workflows/ with pipeline_ prefix
- **pipeline_ui**: Cytoscape.js + cytoscape-dagre for graph visualization; 2-pane approval panel for chat negotiation

## Key Decisions

- Engine/workspace separation: aicli/ contains backend logic only; workspace/ stores per-project content; _system/ holds project state
- Dual storage: JSONL (history.jsonl with rotation) for primary storage; PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector (1536-dim embeddings) for semantic search and per-project indexed tables
- Electron UI with xterm.js + Monaco editor; Vanilla JS frontend (no framework/bundler); Vite dev server for local development
- JWT authentication via python-jose + bcrypt; DEV_MODE toggle; 3-tier roles (admin/paid/free); login as first-level hierarchy
- All LLM providers as independent adapters (Claude, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok); server holds API keys; client sends no keys
- Nested tag hierarchy via parent_id FK with unlimited depth; tags synced across Chat/History/Commits on explicit save
- Load-once-on-access pattern: cache tags/workflows/runs in memory; update DB only on explicit save to eliminate redundant SQL
- Async DAG workflow executor via asyncio.gather with loop-back and max_iterations cap; Cytoscape.js + cytoscape-dagre visualization
- Memory synthesis: Claude Haiku for dual-layer output (raw JSONL → interaction_tags → 5 files); smart chunking per language/section
- MCP server (stdio) with 12+ tools; configured via env vars (BACKEND_URL, ACTIVE_PROJECT)
- Pipelines centralized under workflows/ with pipeline_ prefix; agent tools in agents/tools/ with tool_ prefix; respects configured LLM provider/model per role
- Backend module organization: routers/ for API endpoints, models/ for data structures, agents/tools/ for agent implementations, agents/mcp/ for MCP tooling
- Port binding safety via freePort() to kill stale uvicorn; Electron cleanup via process.exit()
- Graph runner commits via `_apply_code_and_commit` distinct from `git_tool` for existing working tree changes
- Config.py centralizes externalized settings: backend_url, haiku_model, db_pool_max, MCP settings, agent role providers

## Recent Context (last 5 changes)

- [2026-03-21] I do see there is gitops and git_tool under agent_tools, is both needed ?
- [2026-03-21] If pipeline engine use that, it is not better to add that under workflows - also, can you rename that to pipelines for c
- [2026-03-21] There is agents and tools and under tools there agent_tools - I think it will be cleaner to movee agent_tools under agen
- [2026-03-21] Is there is a reason to have tools under mcp as well ?
- [2026-03-21] Ok. we will fix that latter, files under tools can you rename to have prefix tool_ also under mcp - currently there is o
